🧠 GRAPH DATA STRUCTURE – MASTER ROADMAP (with LeetCode)
🔹 Phase 0: Graph Basics (VERY IMPORTANT)

Before solving problems, understand these concepts:

Concepts to learn

What is a graph

Directed vs Undirected

Weighted vs Unweighted

Adjacency List vs Adjacency Matrix

Degree, Path, Cycle

Connected Components

👉 No LeetCode yet. Just concepts + small examples.

🔹 Phase 1: DFS & BFS Basics (Day 1–7)

This is the foundation of all graph problems.

What to master

DFS (recursive & iterative)

BFS (queue based)

Visited array / set

Traversing all nodes

LeetCode Problems (Easy → Medium)

1971 – Find if Path Exists in Graph

733 – Flood Fill

200 – Number of Islands ⭐ (MOST IMPORTANT)

695 – Max Area of Island

463 – Island Perimeter

547 – Number of Provinces
